Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, the most common being coronary artery disease (CAD), which can lead to heart attacks. Other significant conditions include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation.

### Risk Factors
The primary risk factors for CVD include:
- Smoking
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Inactivity
- Being overweight or obese
- Poor diet
- Family history of heart disease

### Symptoms
Symptoms of cardiovascular disease can vary depending on the specific type of disease. Common symptoms include:
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Pain, numbness, weakness, or coldness in your legs or arms
- Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen, or back

### Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease include:
- Quitting smoking
- Eating a heart-healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins
- Exercising regularly
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Managing stress
- Controlling conditions like hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes

### Treatment
Treatment for cardiovascular diseases often involves:
- Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise)
- Medications
- Procedures and surgeries, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery
- Rehabilitation programs for recovery after surgery

### The Importance of Early Detection
Early detection of cardiovascular disease can be life-saving. Regular check-ups are recommended, particularly for individuals with risk factors. Monitoring and managing blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other markers of cardiovascular health can prevent or delay the onset of CVD.

Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate variability occurs naturally, scientists believe that recent changes in climate are primarily caused by human activities. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, human activities have significantly increased the amounts of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, leading to enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.


The primary cause of current climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, which emits various greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, predominantly carbon dioxide. Other activities, such as deforestation and industrial processes, also contribute to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.


The impacts of climate change are profound and far-reaching. Rising average temperatures lead to altered weather patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These changes can devastate ecosystems, affect water resources, reduce agricultural productivity, and threaten food security. Rising sea levels, a direct consequence of melting ice caps and thermal expansion of the oceans, pose significant risks to coastal communities and islands.


Addressing climate change requires concerted global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, commonly referred to as mitigation strategies. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power reduce dependence on fossil fuels and are critical to mitigating climate change. Energy efficiency improvements in buildings, vehicles, and industries are also vital. Additionally, reforestation and forest preservation can enhance the natural carbon sink capacity of forests.


In addition to mitigation, adaptation measures are crucial to cope with the effects of climate change. This includes building flood defenses, creating drought-resistant crops, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. By adapting to the changes that are already underway, communities can better protect themselves against the worst effects of climate change.
